                          This is the QUOTES LIST
                      (Memorable Quotes from Movies)

        Maintained by: Lars Joergen Aas <larsa@colargol.edb.tih.no>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWS:
*) This list will also contain poetry from now on.  The poetry will of course
   not be formatted 76 characters wide, indented by two spaces on the left,
   like the ordinary quotes.

FACTS & FIGURES:
*) This list is supported by the Col Needham's movie database v2.9 and
   upwards (current release: 3.0) and Cardiff's Movie Database Browser (WWW).
   The latter includes hypertext links which isn't easy to implement in
   ASCII-files ;)
*) This list has now quotes and poetry from 361 different movies.
*) It contains 765 individual quotes involving at least 630 different actors.

New titles:		"I, Claudius"
			African Queen, The
			Ask a Policeman
			Cliffhanger
			Deep Red (1994)
			Eve and the Handyman
			Good Morning...and Goodbye!
			Major League
			Manhattan
			Maverick
			Necromania
			Oh, Mr Porter!
			Paint Your Wagon
			Stakeout

CONTRIBUTIONS and CORRECTIONS to this list is welcomed at movie@ibmpcug.co.uk
with the subject "ADD" and the keyword "QUOTE" above all individual quotes.
To find out how to use the email-server use the subject "HELP" instead.

* Include which movie the quotes are taken from.  I would appreciate if the
  movie title is consistent with the movie database, including the optional
  year of release.  Avoid AKA-titles.
* Write in a script-like way (see the list below) and include both the actors'
  real names and the character names.  Both is needed to create hypertext
  links on the WWW browser at Cardiff.  You should at least include one of
  the names.
* Keep narration brief, but do narrate if necessary.
* Don't submit any quote.  Please try to avoid spoilers, and only submit
  quotes which have a certain point to them.  It doesn't need to be a funny
  quote (but they most often will be), but it should be memorable (like Roy's
  last words in `Blade Runner').
* Keep the QUALITY UP and the QUANTITY DOWN.
* The quotes should be correct.  Correct spelling and written _exactly_ as
  it's said in the movie.  When this is not the case, I'm not necessarily the
  one to blame, but I am the one you should notify.

# Ferris Bueller's Day Off

Ferris Bueller:  I did have a test today.  That wasn't bullshit.  It's on
  European socialism.  I mean, really, what's the point?  I'm not European,
  I don't plan on being European, so who gives a crap if they're socialist?
  They could be fascist anarchists - that still wouldn't change the fact
  that I don't own a car.  Not that I condone fascism, or any ism for that
  matter.  Isms in my opinion are not good.  A person should not believe in
  an ism - he should believe in himself.  I quote John Lennon:  "I don't
  believe in Beatles - I just believe in me".  A good point there.  Of
  course, he was the Walrus.  I could be the Walrus - I'd still have to bum
  rides off of people.

Ferris Bueller:  The key to faking out the parents is the clammy hands.
  It's a good non-specific symptom.  A lot of people'll tell you that a
  phony fever is a dead lock, but that can land you in a doctor's office,
  and that's worse than school.  What you do is, you fake a stomach cramp,
  and when you're bent over moaning and wailing, you lick your palms.  It's
  a little childish and stupid, but then, so is high school.

Ferris Bueller:  Pardon my French, but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck
  a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you would have a diamond.

  her...
Alan Lowenthal:  Isaac, you know as well as I do that romantic love is a
  projection.  You're not seeing this woman
Isaac Barr:  Hehe, get out of here...
Alan Lowenthal:  It's a vision..  You're in a delusional state.
Isaac Barr:  It's not deliusional.
Alan Lowenthal:  Yes it is.  It's delusional.  There is no human being, no
  woman that's so beautiful - so special - that all of your normal thought
  patterns
[Heather Evans enters the room]
Alan Lowenthal:  Eh, can I help you?

Heather Evans:  Do you come out here a lot?
Isaac Barr:  No, just in moments of existential anxiety and when I want to

Fletch:  I like men. I like to be manhandled. I like you.

[Fletch is being framed for drug posession by two very large cops]
Fletch:  Aren't you gonna read me my rights?
Cop:  You have the right to remain silent.  You have the right to have your
  face kicked in by me. You have the right to have your balls stomped on by
  him.
Fletch:  I think I'll waive my rights.

[Lt. Steven Hauk uses Army jargon to refer to a press conference to be given
  by former Vice-President Nixon] 
Adrian Cronauer:  Excuse me, sir.  Seeing as how the V.P. is such a V.I.P.,
  shouldn't we keep the P.C. on the Q.T.?  Cause of the leaks to the V.C. he
  could end up M.I.A., and then we'd all be put out in K.P.  

Edward Garlick: "Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off of a dead mans balls."  I
  have no idea what that means, but it seems very negative to me.

  the stock market like a fox, but you store your nuts away like a
  squirrel.

  day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?
Ralph:  That sums it up for me.

[Phil Connors drives (because Ralph and Gus are drunk) right through a
  mailbox]
Gus:  Hey Phil, if we wanted to hit mailboxes we could let Ralph drive.

John Moss:  You can't.  Not by asking someone.
Nick Lang:  Will you open up?  I just want to know what it feels like to be
  inside your skin.
John Moss:  I DON'T WANT YOU INSIDE MY SKIN, YOU UNDERSTAND?  It's private!
  What's in there belongs to me!  You're not gonna learn what it meas to be
  a cop by eating hot dogs and picking your teeth and asking stupid
  questions.  We live this job.  It's something we are, not something we do!
  Every time a cop walks up to a car and has to give a speeding ticket, he
  know he may have to kill someone or be killed himself.  That's not
  something you step into by strapping on a rubber gun and riding around all
  day.  You get to go back to your million dollar beach house and your
  bimbos and your blow jobs and you get 17 takes to get it right.  We get
  one take.  It lasts our whole lives.  We mess it up and we're dead.

Veronica Sawyer:  You inherit 5 million dollars the same day aliens land on
  the earth and say they will blow it up in 2 days.  What do you do?
Jason Dean:  That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.

Courtney:  If I got that money, I'd give it all to the homeless.  Every
  cent.
Veronica Sawyer:  You're beautiful.

Jason Dean:  The extreme always seems to make an impression.

Veronica Sawyer:  I say we just grow up, be adults and die.

Veronica Sawyer:  All we want is to be treated like human beings, not to be
  experimented on like guinea pigs or patronized like bunny rabbits.
Veronica's Dad:  I don't patronize bunny rabbits!

Jason Dean:  Seven schools in seven states and the only thing different is
  my locker combination.

Veronica Sawyer:  If you were happy every day of your life you wouldn't be a
  human being.  You'd be a gameshow host.

Veronica Sawyer:  Heather, why are you such a mega-bitch?
Heather Duke:  Because I can be.

Jason Dean:   Wanna go out tonight?  Catch a movie?  Miniature golf?
Veronica Sawyer:  I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather
  Duke's wrists open, making it look like suicide.
Jason Dean:  Ah, now you're talking.  I can be up for that.  I've already
  started underlining meaningful passages in her copy of Moby Dick, if you
  know what I mean?

Veronica Sawyer:  My teenage angst bullshit now has a bodycount.

Jason Dean:  The only place different social types can genuinely get along
  with each other is in heaven.

Lilly Raines:  I know what it means.
Frank Horrigan:  Really?  I had to look it up...

Mitch Leary:  Watching the president, I couldn't help wondering why a man
  like you would risk his life to save a man like that.  You have such a
  strange job.  I can't decide if it's heroic or absurd.
Frank Horrigan:  Now, why would a man like you risk his life to kill a man

  providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.  THAT is why I am your
  king!
Dennis interrupting:  Listen, strange women lyin' in ponds distributin'
  swords is no basis for a system of government!  Supreme executive power
  derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcicial aquatic
  ceremony!

  because some watery tart threw a sword at you!

  your trunk.
Vincent Antonelli:  You see, I was thinking of writing my story, so I bought
  this one on how to do it.
Hannah Stubbs:  Why do you need 25 copies of it?
Vincent Antonelli:  In case I want to read it more than once...

Vincent Antonelli:  Richie loved to use 22s because the bullets are small
  and they don't come out the other end like a 45, see, a 45 will blow a
  barn door out the back of your head and there's a lot of dry cleaning
  involved, but a 22 will just rattle around like pac man until you're

  and the bandstand by now.

[Benjy Stone and a very drunken Alan Swann are up on a roof as Swann
  attempts to shimmy down the side of the building]
Benjy Stone:  Let's *not* do this - it's too dangerous!

  switched glasses when your back was turned!  Ha-ha, you fool!  You fell
  victim to one of the classic blunders, the most famous of which is "Never
  get involved in a land war in Asia", but only slightly less famous is
  this:  "Never go in against a Sicilian, when *death* is on the line!".
  Hahahahahah!
[Vizzini falls over dead]

Buttercup:  You mock my pain!
Westley:  Life is pain!  Anyone who says different is trying to sell you
  something.

Buttercup:  We'll never survive!
Westley:  Nonsense!  you're only saying that because noone ever has...

Prince Humperdinck:  Surrender!
Westley:  You mean you wish to surrender to me?  Very well, I accept...

Count Rugen:  Get some rest.  If you haven't got your health, you haven't
  got anything.

Inigo Montoya:  Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the king all those
  years?
Miracle Max:  The King's stinking son fired me, and thank you so much for
  bringing up such a painful subject.  While you're at it, why don't you
  give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?  We're closed!

Miracle Max:  Get back, witch!
Valerie:  I'm not a witch, I'm your wife!  And after what you just said, I'm
  not even sure I want to be that any more!

Westley:  Give us the gate key.
Yellin:  I have no gate key.

  sometimes.  Haven't you?

Norman Bates:  I'm not capable of being fooled!  Not even by a woman.

Norman Bates:  Uh-uh, Mother-m-mother, uh, what is the phrase?  She isn't
  quite herself today.

Norman Bates:  She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.

Indiana Jones:  It's not the years honey, it's the mileage.

[Army Intelligence officer describing Indiana Jones]
Officer:  Professor of Archeology, expert on the occult, and how does one
  say it?  Obtainer of rare antiquities.

Indiana Jones:  You want to talk to God?  Let's go see him together, I've
  got nothing better to do!

Rene Belloq:  You and I are very much alike.  Archeology is our religion,
  yet we have both fallen from the pure faith.  Our methods have not
  differed as much as you pretend.  I am but a shadowy reflection of you.
  It would take only a nudge to make you like me.  To push you out of the
  light.
Indiana Jones:  Now you're getting nasty.

Sallah:  Indy, why does the floor move?
Indiana Jones:  Snakes ... why did it hafta be snakes?
Sallah:  Asps ... very dangerous.  You go first.

Indiana Jones:  This site also demonstrates one of the great dangers of
  archeology, not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place,
  I'm talking about folklore.

[Re-re-animating the dead cat in the basement]
Herbert West:  Don't expect it to tango; it has a broken back.

Herbert West:  I must say, Dr. Hill, I'm VERY disappointed in you.  You
  steal the secret of life and death, and here you are trysting with a
  bubble-headed coed.  You're not even a second-rate scientist!


# Real Genius

Old Lady:  Tell me, what's Einstein really like?
Professor Hathaway:  Dead.

Chris Knight:  This?  This is ice.  This is what happens to water when it
  gets too cold.  This?  This is Kent.  This is what happens to people when
  they get too sexually frustrated.

[Mitch Taylor speaking through the microphone so that Kent hears voices in
  his head]
Mitch Taylor:  And from now on, stop playing with yourself!
Kent:  It is God!

Mitch Taylor:  The weirdest thing just happened to me.
Chris Knight:  Was it a dream where you were standing in sort of sun-god
  robes on top of a pyramid, and there were hundreds of naked women
  screaming and throwing little pickles at you?
Mitch Taylor:  No...
Chris Knight:  Why, am I the only one who has that dream?

Chris Knight:  If you think that by threatening me you can get me to do what
  you want...  Well, that's where you're right.  But -- and I am only saying
  that because I care -- there's a lot of decaffeinated brands on the market
  that are just as tasty as the real thing.

Chris Knight:  Would you be prepared if gravity reversed itself?

Professor Hathaway:  What are you looking at?  You're laborers; you should
  be laboring.  That's what you get for not having an education.

Professor Hathaway:  Mitch, will you miss your friends?
Mitch Taylor:  Uh, no sir, I think I intimidated most of them.

[Chris Knight is trying to hit on Cynthia, a beautiful woman he finds in
  Professor Hathaway's house]
Chris Knight:  So, if there's anything I can do for you, or, more to the
  point, to you, you just let me know.
Cynthia:  Can you hammer a six-inch spike through a board with your penis?
Chris Knight:  Not right now.
Cynthia:  A girl's gotta have her standards.
[She walks out]

Kent:  You're all a bunch of degenerates!
Chris Knight:  Oh, really?  Well, what about that time I found you naked
  with that bowl of jello?
Kent:  You did not!
Chris Knight:  This is true.
Kent:  Yeah, well I was hot and I was hungry!

Mitch Taylor:  Did you know there's a guy living in our closet?
Chris Knight:  You've seen him too?
Mitch Taylor:  Who is he?
Chris Knight:  Hollyfeld.
Mitch Taylor:  Why does he keep going into our closet?
Chris Knight:  Why do you keep going into our closet?
Mitch Taylor:  To get my clothes - but that's not why he goes in there!
Chris Knight:  Of course not, he's twice your size - your clothes would
  never fit him!
Mitch Taylor:  Yeah...
Chris Knight:  Think before you ask these questions, Mitch!  Twenty points
  higher than me?  Thinks a big guy like that can wear his clothes?

Chris Knight:  Self-realization.  I was thinking of the immortal words of
  Socrates, when he said, "I drank what?"

  ways...

[Karen McCoy tries to fire the gun in a gunfight]
Karen McCoy:  You didn't load the gun?
J.T. Barker:  You told me to buy it, not to load it.

J.T. Barker:  Do you think that jerk Roy do a better job raising your boy
  than you?
Karen McCoy:  At least Roy is his father.  At least he has a chance of a
  normal life with him...
J.T. Barker:  Normal???  What's not normal about getting on an airplane with
  your mam and go down to Rio with 3 million bucks?

J.T. Barker:  How many of these creeps have you got in your life?

Vickie Miner:  And I think about dying of AIDS all the time. I even dream
  about it.  Only in my dreams, I'm not me:  I'm a character on "Melrose
  Place".  I'm the HIV/AIDS character.  I move into the building and teach
  everyone that it's okay to be close to me.  And then I die, and everyone
  shows up at my funeral, and they're all wearing halter tops and chokers.

  be a trap.
Cato:  It's so obvious, it's bound to be a trap.
Jacques Clouseau:  That is why you'll never be a great detective, Cato.
  It's so obvious that it could not possibly be a trap.

  said all along.

  the greatest prophet since Custer said he was going to surround all those
  Indians!

Commissioner Charles Dreyfus:  What about the maid?
Inspector Jacques Clouseau:  The maid?
Commissioner Charles Dreyfus:  Was he jealous of her too?  He strangled

  Starbase, there is a good chance that we will never see Captain Kirk or
  Doctor McCoy alive again.
Scott:  Could take weeks, sir...

 
# Star Wars

Princess Leia:  Help me Obi-wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.

Han Solo:  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
Luke Skywalker:  What a piece of junk!

Darth Vader:  I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Darth Vader:  Don't be so proud of this technological terror you've
  constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the
  power of the force.

C3PO:  Oh listen to them R2.  They're dying.  Oh curse this metal body!  I
  wasn't fast enough.

Darth Vader:  I sense something.  A presence I haven't felt since...

Obi-wan Kenobi:  You must learn the ways of the force if you're to come with
  me to Alderaan.

C3PO:  Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!

C3PO:  We're doomed!

Han Solo:  Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to
  like her.

Obi-wan:  Who's the more foolish?  The fool or the fool who follows him?

Han Solo:  Travelling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy.

Leia:  Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?

Han Solo:  Get in there you big furry oaf!  I don't care what you smell!

Han:  This isn't going to work.
Luke:  Why didn't you say so before?
Han:  I did say so before!

Darth Vader:  The Force is strong with this one.

Darth Vader:  Commander, tear this ship appart until you've found those
  plans.  And bring me the passengers, I want them alive!

Princess Leia:  Darth Vader, only you could be so bold.

Luke Skywalker:  But who would wanna slotter Jawas?

Han Solo:  Over my dead body!
Greedo:  That's the idea.  I've been looking forward to this for a long
  time.
Han Solo shoots Greedo under the table:  Yes, I BET you have.

[R2D2 and Chewbacca are playing the holographic game on Millennium Falcon]
Chewbacca:  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh
C3PO:  He made a fair move.  Screaming about it can't help it.
Han Solo:  Give it to him.  It's not wise to upset a wookie.
C3PO:  But Sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
Han Solo:  That's because droids don't pull peoples arms out of their
  sockets if they lose.  Wookies are known to do that.
C3PO:  I see your point, Sir.  I suggest a new strategy, R2...  Let the
  wookie win.

Han Solo:  Not a bad bit of rescuing.  You know, sometimes I amaze even
  myself.
Princess Leia Organa:  That doesn't seem too hard.

Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi:  May the force be with you!

Bruno Anthony:  Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you, Mr. Haines.  It
  might disturb mother.

Bruno Anthony:  I have a theory that you should do everything before you
  die.

Guy Haines:  I may be old-fashioned, but I thought murder was against the
  law.

Bruno Anthony:  Everyone has somebody that they want to put out of the way.
  Oh now, surely Madam, you're not going to tell me that there hasn't been a
  time that you didn't want to dispose of someone.  Your husband, for
  instance.

Cigar Biker:  You forgot to say please...

Dr. Silberman:  I'm sure it feels very real to you.
Sarah Connor:  On August 29th 1997 it's gonna feel pretty fucking real to
  you too.  Anybody not wearing 2 million sunblock is gonna have a real bad
  day...  Get it?

John Connor to The Terminator:  Now don't take this the wrong way, but
  you're a terminator, right?

John Connor:  You're not here to kill me - I figured out that for myself.
  So what's the deal?
Terminator:  My mission is to protect you.
John Connor:  Yeah?  Who sent you?
Terminator:  You did.  35 years from now you reprogrammed me to be your
  protector here - in this time.
John Connor:  This is deep...

[John connor is by a telephone booth, wanting to call home]
John Connor to Terminator:  You got a quarter?

[Just like in _The Terminator_ (qv)]
The Terminator:  Come with me if you want to live!

Dr. Silbermann:  How are you supposed to get back?
Kyle Reese:  I can't.  Nobody gets home.  Nobody else comes through.  It's
  just him - and me.

The Terminator:  I'll be back!

[The Terminator is choosing from a list of programmed responses to get rid
  of someone knocking on his door]
Terminator:  Fuck you, asshole.

He:  You may be a cyborg, but I still love you...


# Thelma & Louise

J.D. Tech:  You got an amazing story to tell your friends, if not you got a

J.D. Tech:  Well now, I've always believed if done properly, armed robbery
  doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.

Louise Sawyer:  You get what you settle for.


# They Came from Within

Forsythe:  He tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh, that disease is
  the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other, that even dying
  is an act of eroticism.

# Third Man, The

Harry Lime:  In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare,
  terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da
  Vinci, and the Renaissance.  In Switzerland they had brotherly love --
  they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce?  The

Cowboy:  A which?
Doc Holliday:  You know, Frederic fucking Chopin.

Doc Holliday:  I have two guns, one for each of ya.

  have a spelling contest!  [cracks up laughing]

Wyatt Earp:  Are you gonna do something, or just stand there and bleed?

Wyatt Earp:  You tell him I'm coming!  And hell's coming with me!

Doc Holliday to Johnny Ringo:  Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just
  walked over your grave.

John Ringo:  I want your blood.  And I want your soul.  And I want them both
  right now!

Doc Holliday:  I'm your huckleberry.

[Wyatt Earp has just found out that the devil in a play was performed by a
  woman]
Wyatt Earp:  Well, I'll be damned.
Doc Holliday:  You may indeed, if you get lucky.
 
Doc Holliday:  I have not yet begun to defile myself.

  It is Monday right?

[Earl Bass and Valentine McKee are about to meet Rhonda LeBeck.  Valentine
  McKee pictures her]

# True Romance

Clarence Worley:  Something this last week has taught me; it's better to
  have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it.

Clifford Worley:  Who are you?
Vincenzo Coccotti:  I'm the Anti-Christ.  You get me in a vendetta kind of
  mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen evil so
  singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you.
  My name is Vincenzo Coccotti.

[Don Vincenzo is complaining about how lousy Clifford Worley is to lie]
Vincenzo Coccotti:  Now, what we have got here is a little game of show and
  tell, and you don't wanna show me nothing and tell me everything.

Amos Reed:  Let him go, Hooch!  I'm sorry, Scott.  I don't have the
  hand-strength I used to.  You're OK, aren't you?
Scott Turner:  Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.  I was looking forward to a nice quiet
  cup of coffee, BUT NOW I'M AWAKE!

  want to take a walk with me?
Scott Turner:  No.  No.  Well, you see, I'm starting to like you, and if
  we're going to walk I'm just going to like you even more, and then one day
  we might even end up in love and everything will go on fine for a while,
  but-but then one day *bang* you're gonna call me a selfish compulsive
  bachelor.  You gonna pull your hair, you gonna scream and you gonna say
  you never want to see me again because I drive you crazy, and I'm a lousy
  shot.  Now, who needs that?  Good night.

George Newman:  You're right, Bob.  I'm sorry.  What can I say?  I-I'm a
  miserable worthless hunk of slime.  Here, I want you to take this crowbar
  and just bash my head right in.  Go ahead.  Really!  Just BASH my head
  right in!
Bob:  George, you know I can't do that.  You still owe me 5 bucks.

Bob: I don't know about this, George.  We don't know the first thing about
  what goes on in a television station.
George Newman:  Don't worry, Bob.  It's just like working in a fish-market.
  Except you don't have to clean and gut fish all day.

[In the "Spatula City" advertising commercial]
Sy Greenblum:  Hello, this is Sy Greenblum, president of Spatula City.  I
  like the spatulas so much, I bought the company.

Stanley Spadowski:  George, you know I was wondering, like if you were
  traveling through outer space, I mean like you're going real fast, like
  the speed of light, you know ...hoooohhhhh... and all of a sudden you
  started screaming ...aaaahhhhh aaaaahhhhh...  Do you think your brain

Bob:  Guys, I'm trying to work...  Do you mind?
Stanley Spadowski:  I don't mind.  Go right ahead...  Do you mind, George?

Richard Fletcher:  "Help me out of this box, I can't breathe in here!  Help,

Jim Malone:  You wanna get Capone?  Here's how you get him.  He pulls a

  one of his to the morgue.  That's the Chicago way.  And that's how you get
  Capone!

Bob McGraw:  I like a woman who's not afraid to play hard to get.

Oliver Rose:  You're not equipped to, honey.


# Wayne's World

Mikita's Manager, Glen to the camera:  I'd never done a crazy  thing in my
  life before that night.  Why is it that if a man kills another man in
  battle it's called heroic, yet if he kills a man in the heat of passion
  it's called murder.

Garth Algar:  That is a babe!  She makes me feel kinda funny, like when we
  used to climb the rope in gym-class.

[Talking about Claudia Schiffer]
Wayne Campbell:  She's a babe.
Garth Algar:  She's magically babelicious.
Wayne Campbell:  She tested very high on the stroke-ability scale.

Benjamin:  First let me get this out of the way; I'm a big fan.
Garth Algar:  You are?
Benjamin:  The way I see it; your show is capable of so much more.
Garth Algar:  Well, we'll try harder, OK?  Just give us a second chance.
  Just don't go and cancel us without giving us a second chance!

[Instead of saying "Excuse me, I beg your pardon?" (also in _Wayne's World
  2_ (qv))]
Wayne Campbell:  Exsqueeze me?  Baking powder?

Benjamin:  Do you have a lawyer?
Wayne Campbell:  Yes!  Ahm, no.  We're between lawyers right now.  You see,
  our first lawyer screwed our affairs so bad.
Garth Algar:  That's right.  I walked right to that office - that's what I
  did - and I reached across that desk and I grabbed him by his fat head and
  I  said "Listen man!  I'm not going to jail for YOU or for anybody!".

Terry:  Wayne!  Wayne!  Garth told me about the show, man.  I love you man.
Wayne Campbell:  Yea, and I love you too, Terry.
Terry:  No no no, I mean it man.  I LOVE you!
Wayne Campbell:  No, I-I mean it.  I love you.
Terry:  No you don't, man.  I love you.
Wayne Campbell being hugged by Terry:  Garth!  Hey, come over here, I think
  Terry has something he wants to say to you.
Terry:  I love you, man.
Garth Algar:  Thank you!

Russel:  It will be Terry's job to give the actors their hand cue.
Wayne Campbell:  Exscuse me, Russel, but I believe I requested the hand
  job...

Benjamin Oliver:  So Garth, how do you like being in a studio?
Garth Algar:  Ahm, it's it's like a new pair of underwear, you know...  At
  first it's constrictive, but after a while it becomes a part of you.

[Wayne and Garth is lying on the hood of the merth-mobile, staring at the
  starlit sky]
Garth Algar:  Sometimes I wish I could boldly go where no man has gone
  before ... but I'll probably stay in Aurora.  What are you thinking
  about?
Wayne Campbell:  Cassandra.  She's a fox.  In french she would be called "la
  renarde" and she would be hunted with only her cunning to protect her.
Garth Algar:  She's a babe.
Wayne Campbell:  She's a robo-babe.  In latin she would be called "babia
  majora".
Garth Algar:  If she were a president she would be Baberaham Lincoln.
[A brief pause]
Garth Algar:  Did you ever find Bugs Bunny attractive when he put on a dress
  and played girl bunny?
Wayne Campbell cracks up laughing:  No...  No!
Garth Algar:  Neither did I.  I was just asking.

Mikita's Manager, Glen:  Anything wrong, Davy?
Davy:  Yeah, I got paid today.
Mikita's Manager, Glen:  Yeah, I know what that's like.
Davy:  No.  You don't understand.  They laid me off.  I got one of these.
Mikita's Manager, Glen:  Yeah, I know how that feels.
Davy:  Know what I'd like to do?
Mikita's Manager, Glen:  Yeah I know what you'd like to do.  You'd like to
  find the guy who did it, rip his still beating heart out of his chest and
  hold it in front of his face so he can see how black it is before he
  dies.
Davy:  Actually, I was thinking of filing a disagreement with the union.
Mikita's Manager, Glen:  Well, the world's a twisted place.

Mikita's Manager, Glen:  You know, if you stab a man in the dead of winter,
  steam will rise up from the wounds.  Indians believed it was his soul
  escaping from his body.

Garth Algar:  OK ... First I'll access the secret military spy sattelite
  that is in geosynchronous orbit over Mid-West.  Then I'll ID the limo by
  the vanity plate "MR. BIGGG" and get his approximate position.  Then I'll
  reposition the transmission dish on the remote truck to 17,32 degrees
  east, hit WESTAR 4 over the Atlantic, bounce the signal back into the
  aerosphere up to COMSAT 6, beam it back to SATCOM 2 transmitter number 137
  and down on the dish on the back of Mr. Big's limo...  It's almost too
  easy.

[See _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_ (qv)]
[Wayne Campbell is stopped by a traffic cop]
Wayne Campbell:  Yes, officer, is there a problem?
T-1000:  Have you seen this boy?

Cassandra:  I don't believe I've ever had French champagne before...
Benjamin Kane:  Oh, actually all champagne is French, it's named after the
  region.  Otherwise it's sparcling white wine.  Americans of course don't
  recognize the convention so it becomes that thing of calling all of their
  sparkling white champagne, even though by definition they're not.
Wayne Campbell:  Ah yes, it's a lot like _"Star Trek: The Next Generation"_
  (qv).  In many ways it's superior but will never be as recognized as the
  original.
